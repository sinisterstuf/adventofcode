The Santa navigator program reads input like <<>V^V<<<>V in stdin and
returns a number, the number number of houses Santa would have visited,
following these instructions as:

^ North
> East
v South
< West

For example:

echo '>>' | ./navigator

outputs: 3

You can specify multiple Santas to travel simultaneously by providing
the number of santas as an argument, e.g.:

./navigator 2 <input.txt

To compile from source, just run `make`.

The code is based on a linked list of houses.  Every time a character is
read, it is mapped to coordinates and a new house is added to the list
with coordinates based on the last house and the current movement.  If
there are multiple Santas they each take a turn to move.  Finally each
Santa's house list is uniq'd into a long list of unique houses which is
counted to provide the final result.
